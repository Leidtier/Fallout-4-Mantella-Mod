Bring Fallout 4 NPCs to life with AI

This repository is for the Mantella Mod, which handles the Fallout4-side logic of Mantella. For the current Fallout4 Mantella repository, see [here](https://github.com/YetAnotherModder/Mantella).

The .esp is converted to version-control-friendly .yaml files using [Spriggit](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Spriggit).

The esp is NOT currently compatible with Fallout 4 VR.
To operate the mod these plugins are required:
[F4SE](https://f4se.silverlock.org/).
[SUP F4SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/55419).
[Textinputmenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/27347).

Compatibility issues : 
[WARS - Weapon Addition and Replacement Suite](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/73478).

Known bugs:
Mantella may crash while loading older voice models, this issue can usually be remediated by starting a Mantella conversation with a newer 3.0 model and trying again to start a conversation with the older voice model.
Radiant targeting system will try to start conversation with inanimate objects like turrrets.
Currently no support for unlisted NPCs and generic NPCs suchs as guards.
